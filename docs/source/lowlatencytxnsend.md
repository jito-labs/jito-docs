## System Overview
![System Diag](../images/systemdiagram.png)

### üåê How does the system work?
- Validators run a modified Agave validator client called Jito-Solana that enables higher value capture for them and their stakers
  - The validator then connects to the Jito Block-Engine and Jito-Relayer
  - The Block-Engine submits profitable bundles to the validator
  - The Relayer acts as a proxy to filter and verify transactions for validators
- Searchers, dApps, Telegram bots and others connect to the Block-Engine and submit transactions & bundles.
  - Submissions can be over gRPC or JSON-RPC
  - Bundles have tips bids associated with them; these bids are then redistributed to the validators and their stakers

### üíº What are bundles?
- Bundles are groups of transactions (max 5) bundled together
- The transactions are executed sequentially and atomically meaning all-or-nothing
- Bundles enable complex MEV strategies like atomic arbitrage
- Bundles compete against other bundles on tips to the validator

### üì¨ How do Bundles work?
- Traders submit bundle to block engines
- Block engines simulate bundles to determine the most profitable combinations
- Winning bundles are sent to validators to include in blocks
- Validators execute bundles atomically and collect tips
- MEV rewards from bundles are distributed to validators and stakers

### ‚öñÔ∏è What is the auction?
- Bundles submitted by traders are put through a priority auction
  - An auction is needed since opportunities and blockspace are scarce
  - One bundle landing may invalidate another, so Jito selects the higher value of the two
- Parallel auctions are run at 200ms ticks
  - Bundles touching different accounts will run in different parallel auctions
  - Bundles write locking the same accounts end up in the same auction
- Jito submits the highest paying combination of bundles to the validator up to some CU limit

## API
You can send JSON-RPC requests to any Block Engine using the following URLs. To route to a specific region, specify the desired region:

| Location        | URL                                                     |

### üì® Transactions(`/api/v1/transactions`)

For single transaction-related methods, use the URL path `/api/v1/transactions`

For example: `https://mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf/api/v1/transactions`

#### sendTransaction

This method acts as a direct proxy to the Solana sendTransaction RPC method, but forwards your transaction directly to the validator. By default, it submits the transaction with providing MEV protection.

Please note that Jito enforces a minimum tip of 1000 lamports for bundles. During high-demand periods, this minimum tip might not be sufficient to successfully navigate the auction, so it‚Äôs crucial to set both a priority fee and an additional Jito tip to optimize your transaction's chances. Please see [Tip Amounts](#tip-amount)

For added security, you can enable revert protection by setting the query parameter bundleOnly=true. With this setting, the transaction is sent exclusively as a single transaction bundle.

Additionally, this method always sets skip_preflight=true, which means the transaction won't be simulated in the RPC before being sent to the leader.

##### Request

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                      |

##### Response

| Field   | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                         |

  "id": 1
}
```

#### JSON-RPC Authentication (UUID):

Please include the following when authenticating with a URL using a UUID:

    Header Field: Include the API key in the x-jito-auth header.

        Example: x-jito-auth: <uuid>

    Query Parameter: Include the API key as a query parameter.

        Example: api/v1/bundles?uuid=<uuid>

### üíº Bundles (`/api/v1/bundles`)

Bundles are a list of up to 5 transactions that execute sequentially and atomically, ensuring an all-or-nothing outcome. Here‚Äôs what that means:

  - **Sequentially:** Transactions in a bundle are guaranteed to execute in the order they are listed.
  - **Atomically:** Bundles execute within the same slot(e.g. a bundle cannot cross slot boundaries). If the entire bundle executes successfully, all transactions are committed to the chain.
  - **All-or-Nothing:** Bundles can only contain successful transactions. If any transaction in a bundle fails, none of the transactions in the bundle will be committed to the chain.

This guarantees that all transactions in a bundle are executed in sequence and either all succeed or none are executed.

For bundle-related methods, use the URL path `/api/v1/bundles`. Refer to the documentation to see the available JSON-RPC endpoints for bundles.

#### sendBundle

Submits a bundled list of signed transactions (base-58 encoded strings) to the cluster for processing. The transactions are atomically processed in order, meaning if any transaction fails, the entire bundle is rejected (all or nothing). This method relays the bundle created by clients to the leader without any modifications. If the bundle is set to expire after the next Jito-Solana leader, this method immediately returns a success response with a `bundle_id`, indicating the bundle has been received. This does not guarantee the bundle will be processed or land on-chain. To check the bundle status, use `getBundleStatuses` with the `bundle_id`.

A tip is necessary for the bundle to be considered. The tip can be any instruction, top-level or CPI, that transfers SOL to one of the 8 tip accounts. Clients should ensure they have sufficient balance and state assertions allowing the tip to go through conditionally, especially if tipping as a separate transaction. If the tip is too low, the bundle might not be selected during the auction. Use `getTipAccounts` to retrieve the tip accounts. Ideally, select one of the accounts at random to reduce contention.

##### Request

##### Response Example

```json

    "id": 1
}
```

#### getBundleStatuses

Returns the status of submitted bundle(s). This function operates similarly to the Solana RPC method `getSignatureStatuses`. If a `bundle_id` is not found or has not landed, it returns `null`. If found and processed, it returns context information including the slot at which the request was made and results with the `bundle_id(s)` and the transactions along with their slot and confirmation status.

We use `getSignatureStatuses` with the default value of `searchTransactionHistory` set to `false` to check transaction statuses on-chain. This means the RPC call will search only its recent history, including all recent slots plus up to `MAX_RECENT_BLOCKHASHES` rooted slots for the transactions. Currently, `MAX_RECENT_BLOCKHASHES` is 300.

##### Request

| Parameter | Type           | Description                                                                                       |

These endpoints are specifically designed to optimize your MEV strategies, offering precise control over bundle and transaction management on Solana. Dive into the repos to get started, explore detailed documentation, and discover how you can integrate these powerful tools into your MEV workflows.

## Tips

(tip-amount)=
### ü™ô Tip Amount

#### sendTransaction
When using `sendTransaction`, it is recommended to use a 70/30 split between priority fee and jito tip(e.g.):

```
    Priority Fee (70%): 0.7 SOL
    +
    Jito Tip (30%): 0.3 SOL
    ===========================
    Total Fee: 1.0 SOL
```

So, when using sendTransaction:

    You would allocate 0.7 SOL as the priority fee.
    And 0.3 SOL as the Jito tip.

#### sendBundle
When using `sendBundle`, only the Jito tip matters.

## Rate Limits
‚ùì What are the defaults? <br/>

  5 requests per second per IP per region.

‚ùì How do they work? <br/>

  You no longer need an approved auth key for default sends.

‚ùì What happens if the rate limit is exceeded? <br/>

  429 or rate limit error indicating what you hit.

‚ùì What happens if see `The supplied pubkey is not authorized to generate a token`? </br>

  This indicates that you're either using the auth-key parameter or your keypair variable is being set to check for this key unnecessarily. In most cases, you can simply use Null or None for these fields. Many of the new SDKs will have this built-in by default, so you won't need to specify it manually.

## Troubleshooting
‚ùì How to know how much to set priority fee?

  Please see [Tip Amount for sendTransaction](#tip-amount)

‚ùì How to know how much to set a tip?

  The minumim tips is 1000 lamports

‚ùì My bundle/tx is not landing, how do I check?

  If this is your first time using bundles, please ensure you transaction are valid through `simulateTransaction`, and Jito-Solana RPC should support `simulateBundle` to verify bundles.

  If you have the `bundleID`, you can look over [Jito explorer](https://explorer.jito.wtf/), otherwise you can see basic inflight knowledge **within the last 5 minutes** through `getInflightBundleStatuses`.

  The minimum tip is 1000 lamports, but if you're targeting a highly competitive MEV opportunity, you'll need to be strategic with your tip. Consider adjusting your tip amount, based on the [current pricing](#get-tip-information) of tips in the system, and also take into account the latency to each component you're interacting with to maximize your chances of success.

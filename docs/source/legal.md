#### b. Dispute Resolution

Prior to commencing any legal proceeding of any kind against us, including an arbitration, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any Claim by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such negotiation requires that the aggrieved party provide written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the dispute (the "Initial Notice"). The party receiving the Initial Notice shall have 20 days to respond, and within 45 days after the Initial Notice was sent, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to try and resolve the Claim.

### 14. Severability

If any portion of the Terms are held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remainder of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to effectuate the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from the Terms, but the rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.

### 15. Notice

Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

We will not discriminate against any user for exercising their CCPA rights.

You may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. To protect your information, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request, including by collecting additional information to verify your identity, such as government issued identification documents. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the individual about whom we collected personal information. We will only use the personal information provided in the verification process to verify your identity or authority to make a request and to track and document request responses, unless you initially provided the information for another purpose. When we verify your agent's request, we may verify your identity and request a signed document from your agent that authorizes your agent to make the request on your behalf. To protect your personal information, we reserve the right to deny a request from an agent who does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.

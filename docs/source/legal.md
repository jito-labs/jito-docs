Prior to commencing any legal proceeding of any kind against us, including an arbitration, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any Claim by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such negotiation requires that the aggrieved party provide written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the dispute (the "Initial Notice"). The party receiving the Initial Notice shall have 20 days to respond, and within 45 days after the Initial Notice was sent, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to try and resolve the Claim.

### 14. Severability

If any portion of the Terms are held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remainder of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to effectuate the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from the Terms but the rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.

### 15. Notice

If you are a California resident, you have certain additional rights with respect to personal information about you under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA").

We are required to inform you of:

- What categories of information we may collect about you, including during the preceding 12 months;
- The purposes for which we may use your personal information, including during the preceding 12 months;
- The purposes of which we may share your personal information, including during the preceding 12 months;
- In the preceding 12 months, we have not sold any personal information of consumers.

You have the right to request to know: (i) the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months; (ii) the specific pieces of personal information we have about you; (iii) the categories of sources from which that personal information was collected; (iv) the categories of your personal information that we sold or disclosed in the last 12 months, if applicable; (v) the categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold or disclosed in the last 12 months; and (vi) the purpose for collecting and selling your personal information, if applicable. These rights are subject to limitations as described in the relevant law. We may deny your request if we need to do so to comply with our legal rights or obligations.

We will not discriminate against any user for exercising their CCPA rights.

You may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. To protect your information, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request, including by collecting additional information to verify your identity, such as government issued identification documents. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the individual about whom we collected personal information. We will only use the personal information provided in the verification process to verify your identity or authority to make a request and to track and document request responses, unless you initially provided the information for another purpose. When we verify your agent's request, we may verify your identity and request a signed document from your agent that authorizes your agent to make the request on your behalf. To protect your personal information, we reserve the right to deny a request from an agent who does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@jito.wtf.

## Bundles

Bundles are a list of up to 5 transactions that execute sequentially and atomically, ensuring an all-or-nothing outcome. Hereâ€™s what that means:

    Sequentially: Transactions in a bundle are guaranteed to execute in the order they are listed.

    Atomically: Bundles execute within the same slot(e.g. a bundle cannot cross slot boundaries). If the entire bundle executes successfully, all transactions are committed to the chain.

    All-or-Nothing: Bundles can only contain successful transactions. If any transaction in a bundle fails, none of the transactions in the bundle will be committed to the chain.

This guarantees that all transactions in a bundle are executed in sequence and either all succeed or none are executed.

For bundle-related methods, use the URL path /api/v1/bundles. Refer to the documentation to see the available JSON-RPC endpoints for bundles.
